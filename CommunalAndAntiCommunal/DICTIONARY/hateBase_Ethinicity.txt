Many such migrants to Australia, such as Prime Minister Julia Gillard, call themselves 'ten pound poms', because they paid ten pounds for their passage to Australia between 1945 and 1972 under an assisted migration scheme. Often combined with an adjective, particularly whingeing pom, a reference to migrants who complained about their adopted country. Often used in a sporting (especially cricket and rugby) context, with liberal use of 'pom' and 'Aussie' being used by the media; the term is often seen as unoffensive in this context, and instead as light-hearted banter by those who use it, but still possibly as offensive by those whom it is directed at.","language":"eng","about_ethnicity":"0","about_nationality":"1","about_religion":"0","about_gender":"0","about_sexual_orientation":{},"about_disability":"0","about_class":"0","archaic":"0","number_of_revisions":"0","number_of_variants":"0","variants":{},"number_of_sightings":"684","last_sighting":"2016-04-14 19:38:48","number_of_citations":"0"},{"vocabulary":"popolo","variant_of":{},"pronunciation":{},"meaning":"Used in Hawaii to denote a black person.","language":"eng","about_ethnicity":"1","about_nationality":"0","about_religion":"0","about_gender":"0","about_sexual_orientation":{},"about_disability":"0","about_class":"0","archaic":"0","number_of_revisions":"0","number_of_variants":"0","variants":{},"number_of_sightings":"291","last_sighting":"2016-04-14 22:04:23","number_of_citations":"0"},{"vocabulary":"poppadom","variant_of":{},"pronunciation":{},"meaning":"Used as a derogatory term directed towards South Asians (and sometimes Middle Eastern people).","language":"eng","about_ethnicity":"1","about_nationality":"0","about_religion":"0","about_gender":"0","about_sexual_orientation":{},"about_disability":"0","about_class":"0","archaic":"0","number_of_revisions":"0","number_of_variants":"0","variants":{},"number_of_sightings":"10","last_sighting":"2013-04-20 20:45:32","number_of_citations":"0"},{"vocabulary":"porch monkey","variant_of":{},"pronunciation":{},"meaning":"A black person referring to perceived common behavior of groups hanging out on front porches or steps of urban apartment complexes in US cities.","language":"eng","about_ethnicity":"1","about_nationality":"0","about_religion":"0","about_gender":"0","about_sexual_orientation":{},"about_disability":"0","about_class":"0","archaic":"0","number_of_revisions":"0","number_of_variants":"0","variants":{},"number_of_sightings":"2861","last_sighting":"2016-04-14 20:44:25","number_of_citations":"0"},{"vocabulary":"powderburn","variant_of":{},"pronunciation":{},"meaning":"A black person.","language":"eng","about_ethnicity":"1","about_nationality":"0","about_religion":"0","about_gender":"0","about_sexual_orientation":{},"about_disability":"0","about_class":"0","archaic":"0","number_of_revisions":"0","number_of_variants":"0","variants":{},"number_of_sightings":"0","last_sighting":{},"number_of_citations":"0"},{"vocabulary":"prairie nigger","variant_of":{},"pronunciation":{},"meaning":"A Native American.","language":"eng","about_ethnicity":"1","about_nationality":"0","about_religion":"0","about_gender":"0","about_sexual_orientation":{},"about_disability":"0","about_class":"0","archaic":"0","number_of_revisions":"0","number_of_variants":"0","variants":{},"number_of_sightings":"73","last_sighting":"2016-04-13 18:17:44","number_of_citations":"0"},{"vocabulary":"prod","variant_of":{},"pronunciation":{},"meaning":"A Protestant, particularly a rival kid from a Protestant school.
