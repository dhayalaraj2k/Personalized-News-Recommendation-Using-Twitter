# Personalized-News-Recommendation-Using-Twitter

### ABSTRACT:
A Blog is an online journal or informational site displaying useful information. It is
a platform where a writer shares his views on an individual subject. There are news
blogs, story blogs and many other blogs. Twitter is a social media platform that has
become increasingly popular with academics as well as students, policymakers,
politicians and the general public. Both news articles (news blogs) and twitter provide
us with useful information. But it is not always the case that the news articles and
tweets of one’s liking can be found easily. Our project aims to introduce a
recommendation system where users can input their topic of interest and get tweets
and news articles of their topic of interest as output. The tweet and news articles
recommendation are achieved by machine learning techniques. Generally, a tweet or
a news article has no fixed topics and it is mostly based upon the user’s mood swings.
Also, a user may not stay interested in a particular topic for so long. In this paper, we
introduce LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (LDA) for blog and tweet topic model
construction. We also use voting algorithm to find similar topics that are liked by
similar users. The tweets are also classified as communal and non-communal that can
be used to classify tweets during violence or disaster times.

### INTRODUCTION:
Newspaper was the main source by which information and news across the world
was conveyed for many years. Today, in this Digital world where everyone has access to
internet nobody likes to read newspaper. There are many news articles apps where one
can read what’s happening around the world. Twitter is one of the social media
platforms where one can gain lots of information. There are people who sometimes
might have the time to read news blog but sometimes prefer tweets with news. So, we
devised a new idea of creating a place where the users can get both news blog and
tweets recommendation in the same place. We used LDA algorithm to classify the
tweets and news articles into similar topics and then recommend them based on their
topic name that we assign to them. We tune the recommendation system by issuing
more recommendations for the users using voting algorithm. We also use communal
and non-communal classification to create a classifier system.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Implementation of a social network system where the users are recommended
tweets and news blogs according to their interests and after a period of time
recommendation based on their likes and dislikes with classification of communal and noncommunal tweets.
